suggestions for improvement:
- The `move_validator` function currently only prompts the user once if the space is taken. It should loop until a valid move is entered.
- Input validation could be improved to handle non-integer inputs.
- The code can be made more modular by separating the tie-checking logic from the `is_winner` function.
- Consider adding a docstring to each function to explain its purpose.
- The board representation `spaces` can be a global variable but it's better to pass it to the functions that use it, or encapsulate it in a class. This makes the code more reusable and less prone to side effects.
- The game does not terminate if there is a tie
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code implements the core Tic Tac Toe game logic as described in the instructions. It represents the board, takes player input, checks for a winner, and implements the main game loop. However, it has a flaw in the `move_validator` and tie checking. It mostly aligns with all steps defined in the instructions, except validating tie game.
- readability: The code is reasonably well-structured with functions, making it relatively easy to follow. However, adding comments and docstrings would further improve readability. Variable names are generally descriptive.
- performance: The performance is adequate for a simple Tic Tac Toe game. There are no obvious performance bottlenecks.
- security: The code is vulnerable to input validation issues. Specifically, it doesn't handle non-integer inputs or inputs outside the valid range (1-3), which could lead to errors. It is exposed to basic user error but it does not have external dependencies or network interaction.
