suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 3 is missing.
- In the `Siamese` class, the `sing` method is not needed. You can just inherit from `Cat` without adding anything specific if there are no unique behaviors.
- The code can be refactored to reduce redundant code (e.g., the `sing` method in `Bengal` and `Chartreux` is identical).

suggestions for improvement:
- In the `play` method, the output string should include the names of all dogs passed in `*args`, but currently only prints the name of the instance on which the method is called and the `args` tuple itself.
- In the `play` method, the arguments *args are names of dog instances not strings. The code should reflect that.
- Ensure that the `Dog` class is correctly imported from the `exercisesXP` file, and it has the attributes expected by the `PetDog` class (name, age, and weight). This was assumed but not explicitly verified.
