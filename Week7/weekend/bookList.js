/*Exercise 7 : My Book List
The point of this challenge is to display a list of two books on your browser.

In the body of the HTML page, create an empty section:
<section class="listBooks"></section>

In the js file, create an array called allBooks.This is an array of objects.Each object is a book that has 4 keys(ie. 4 properties) :
title,
    author,
    image : a url,
        alreadyRead : which is a boolean(true or false).

Initiate the array with 2 books of your choice(ie.Add manually 2 books objects in the array)

Requirements : All the instructions below need to be coded in the js file:
Using the DOM, render each book inside a div (the div must be added to the <section> created in part 1).
For each book :
You have to display the book’s title and the book’s author.
Example: HarryPotter written by JKRolling.
The width of the image has to be set to 100px.
If the book is already read. Set the color of the book’s details to red.
